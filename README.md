# Caeora's Maps, Tokens, and Assets

![Caeora's Maps, Tokens, and Assets](https://github.com/Caeora/Caeora-s-Maps-Tokens-Assets/blob/main/docs/caeora-maps-tokens-assets.gif?raw=true)

A collection of maps, tokens, and tiles by Caeora and KTech for use with Foundry VTT. Maps that include walls, lighting, and other audio and visual effects have been created by Voldemalort.

Additional Maps. Tokens, and Assets by Caeora and KTech can be found at [caeora.com](http://www.caeora.com).

## Maps

Maps are available under a compendium called "Caeora's Maps" after enabling the module. They can be imported in bulk or you can simply drag a map you wish to use to the Scenes tab.

Maps may include additional assets required by the scene. These assets can be found by navigating to `modules/caeora-maps-tokens-assets/assets/maps/map-name/`.

### Recommended Foundry VTT Modules

All of the included scenes should display beautifully without the need for any additional modules, but there are a handful of modules that, if installed and enabled, will enhance your experience with these scenes. The recommended modules are as follows:

* [FX Master](https://gitlab.com/mesfoliesludiques/foundryvtt-fxmaster) - adds weather effects and other animations to maps
* [Lock View](https://github.com/CDeenen/LockView/issues) - allows for greater configuration of the original scene state
* [Perfect Vision](https://github.com/dev7355608/perfect-vision) - enables global dim lighting for some maps
* [Terrain Layer](https://github.com/wsaunders1014/TerrainLayer) - allows areas of difficult terrain to be seen
* [Wall Height](https://github.com/schultzcole/FVTT-Wall-Height) - enables walls to be of set height so that characters flying will see over them
* [Multilevel Tokens](https://github.com/grandseiken/foundryvtt-multilevel-tokens) - enhances maps with multiple levels by cloning tokens in shared regions and allowing teleportation between maps

All of these modules should be available to install from within Foundry itself.

## Tokens

Tokens can be found by navigating to `modules/caeora-maps-tokens-assets/assets/tokens/`.

## Assets

Assets can be found by navigating to `modules/caeora-maps-tokens-assets/assets/tiles/`. We recommend holding `SHIFT` while placing tiles to preserve their original aspect ratio (as of Foundry 0.7.9).
