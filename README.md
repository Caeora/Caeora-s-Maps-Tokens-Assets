# Caeora's Maps, Tokens, and Assets

## Maps

Maps are available under a compendium called "Caeora's Maps" after enabling the module. They can be imported in bulk or you can simply drag a map you wish to use to the Scenes tab.

Maps may include additional assets required by the scene. These assets can be found by navigating to `modules/caeora-maps-tokens-assets/assets/maps/map-name/`.

### Recommended Foundry VTT Modules

All of the included scenes should display beautifully without the need for any additional modules, but there are a handful of modules that, if installed and enabled, will enhance your experience with these scenes. The recommended modules are as follows:

* FXMaster - adds weather effects and other animations to maps
* Lock View - allows for greater configuration of the original scene state
* Perfect Vision - enables global dim lighting for some maps
* Terrain Layer - allows areas of difficult terrain to be seen
* Wall Height - enables walls to be of set height so that characters flying will see over them

## Tokens (WIP)

Tokens can be found by navigating to `modules/caeora-maps-tokens-assets/assets/tokens/`.

## Tiles (WIP)

Tiles can be found by navigating to `modules/caeora-maps-tokens-assets/assets/tiles/`.
