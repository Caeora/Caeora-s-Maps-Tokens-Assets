# Caeora's Maps, Tokens, and Assets

A collection of maps, tokens, and tiles by Caeora for use with Foundry VTT. Maps include walls, lighting, and other audio and visual effects.

## Maps

Maps are available under a compendium called "Caeora's Maps" after enabling the module. They can be imported in bulk or you can simply drag a map you wish to use to the Scenes tab.

Maps may include additional assets required by the scene. These assets can be found by navigating to `modules/caeora-maps-tokens-assets/assets/maps/map-name/`.

### Recommended Foundry VTT Modules

All of the included scenes should display beautifully without the need for any additional modules, but there are a handful of modules that, if installed and enabled, will enhance your experience with these scenes. The recommended modules are as follows:

* [FX Master](https://gitlab.com/mesfoliesludiques/foundryvtt-fxmaster) - adds weather effects and other animations to maps
* [Lock View](https://github.com/CDeenen/LockView/issues) - allows for greater configuration of the original scene state
* [Perfect Vision](https://github.com/dev7355608/perfect-vision) - enables global dim lighting for some maps
* [Terrain Layer](https://github.com/wsaunders1014/TerrainLayer) - allows areas of difficult terrain to be seen
* [Wall Height](https://github.com/schultzcole/FVTT-Wall-Height) - enables walls to be of set height so that characters flying will see over them

## Tokens (WIP)

Tokens can be found by navigating to `modules/caeora-maps-tokens-assets/assets/tokens/`.

## Tiles (WIP)

Tiles can be found by navigating to `modules/caeora-maps-tokens-assets/assets/tiles/`.
